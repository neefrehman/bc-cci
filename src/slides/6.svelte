		<p>But I arrived at my role as a technologist in quite a roundabout way.</p>
		<p>
			And this is one of the reasons Alex wanted me to speak to you all, as you're
			also mixing multiple practices and skillsets.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started off in the sciences, moving to London to study Physics at university.
			Following that I worked briefy as a data-scientist for a DNA sequencing
			company. Not work I truly enjoyed, but luckily through data science I found an
			enjoyment for design and interactivity through data visualisation.
		</p>
		<p>
			After that job I wokred for a co-working space for a little while, doing
			general operations work and some project management. Again, not work that I
			enjoyed, but it gave me a lot of space to further pursue my interest in design.

			So by now you can tell that I've got a lot of career baggage. Something that
			I'll dive into more later.

			Just over four years ago I got in touch with ustwo, and spoke to Mills (one of
			the founders). This was at a time where ustwo was launching their "Adventure"
			arm, where they invest, ran a community workspace (where I met Alex).
