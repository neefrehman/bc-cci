	<Notes>
		<p>
			I'll run through a few projects of mine now, and we'll also go through some of
			ustwo's work in more detail.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's also worth mentioning that my personal projects are just that. They are
			things that I've found interesting or fun to do, but not client projects that
			I've been asked to work on. As a result they are quite small, but hopefully
			some of the thinking behind them and process will be interesting.
