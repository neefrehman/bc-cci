			It's very easy to look at your journey and say (in my case) "i've moved from a
			scientific practice to a design practice to a coding practice". but the reality
			is that over your career what you're cultivating is a "you" practice, that
			incorporates everything you've done so far.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simplifying this practice down to it's component parts might be helpful at
			times depending on focus and who you need to sell your skills to. But one thing
			that I've learned in my time trying to be "multi-discipline", is that
			simplification puts you in a box whenever it opens doors for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not something you need to consider all the time, but reminding yourself
			about your "you" practice can be helpful tool to enable more fluid and diverse
			problem solving, and critical thinking about what parts of your practice are
			needed in the moment.
