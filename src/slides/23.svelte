			But in reality your career looks a lot more like this: multiple facets and
			inspirations and experiences, that still feed into you now, and relate to one
			another in ways that only you can see. As well as my degree and the jobs I've
			had since, my time working in customer service, my love of film, photography
			work, and all my other baggage, shape my work.

			Over your career you're not moving from one discreet practice to the next, and
			you're not even merging different practices into one. What you're actually
			cultivating is a "you" practice, that incorporates everything you've done so
			far. It grows with time, and the areas within it that you focus on will change,
			but they'll always be there. It's quile literally a collection of all your
			baggage.
