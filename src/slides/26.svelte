			From a "pure" or more traditional artistic practice, the idea of building
			consensus into the work doesn't come top of mind. An artist doesn't necessarily
			have to reach an agreement with their canvas or paintbrush, though that might
			be an interesting provocation

			broadly, requires you think about consensus in quite a multi-layered way,
			starting with the medium, which is the computer.
