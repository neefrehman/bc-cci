	<Notes>
		<p>
			I think especially important as a reminder, because many people will only want
			to see this part of you and your practice, as it's easier for them to grasp and
			see how you can fit into their model of value exchange. You'll frequently have
			to consider simplifying yourself down.
		</p>
		<p>
			Doing so might be valuable to you also, at times, depending on your focus and
			who you need to sell your skills to. But one thing that I've learned in my time
			trying to be "multi-discipline", is that whenever simplification opens a door
			for you it also puts you in a box. This is something I still deal with a lot,
			especially now I'm a software developer full-time.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not something you need to consider all the time, but I really encourage
			reminding yourself of your baggage in a broad sense, and your "you" practice.
			It can be helpful tool to enable more fluid and diverse problem solving, as
			well as critical thinking about what parts of your practice are needed in the
			moment.
