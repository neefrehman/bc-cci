	<Notes>
		<p>Earlier I showed you this diagram about my career path so far.</p>
		<p>
			Quite simple to understand, but I think these days, and especially for
			multi-discipline practitioners, thinking about your skillset as a linear
			progression  can do you more harm than good.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's very easy to look at your journey and say (in my case) "i've moved from a
			scientific practice to a design practice to a coding practice".
