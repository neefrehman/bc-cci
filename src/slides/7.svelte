	<Notes>
		<p>
			One thing led to another and after a little while I joined the team. Initially
			as a bit of a hybrid, some entry-level design work and some venture generalist
			stuff. Although it quickly became that second part that required most of my
			time, which I didn't mind, as I actually enjoyed it quite a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was quite a crash course in business and culture. Working to find, invest
			in, and support companies has a lot of components, from financial modelling to
			people skills. I got exposed to a lot of creativity in that role, which is
			where Alex and I met. And I also got to still do design work, and even start
			learning web development. This site is probably my first "end-to-end" project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the three years in Adventure those various skills grew quite a lot,
			especially web development. I had contributed bits and pieces to projects in
			the studio side of ustwo, so when Adventure was disbanded last year I moved
			over there full time, and now work in the tech team on client projects.
