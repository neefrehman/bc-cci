	<Notes>
		<p>
			One thing led to another and I joined the team. Initially as a bit of a hybrid,
			some entry-level design work and some venture generalist stuff. Although it
			quickly became the venture stuff that required most of my time, which I didn't
			mind as I actually enjoyed it quite a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was quite a crash course in business and culture. Working to find, invest
			in, and support creative companies has a lot of components, from financial
			modelling to people skills. I also got to still do design work, and even
			strarted learning web development. This site is probably my first "end-to-end"
			project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the three years in Adventure those various skills grew quite a lot,
			especially web development. As a result when that team was disbanded last year
			I moved into the studio side of ustwo and now work in the tech theam there.
