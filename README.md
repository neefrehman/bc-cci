# Baggage Collection

Slides and notes for my talk at UAL's Creative Computing Institute.

To get started, fork and download this repo, then run:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev -- --open
```

This should start a dev server and open the slides in your browser.

>NOTE: These slides were designed to be shared from my screen over a video call, so I haven't spent any time getting them to work on smaller screens. Sorry :)

>NOTE 2: This project was made with `svelte@next` while it was in pre-release, so there are potentially some bugs.
