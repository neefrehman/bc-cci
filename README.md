# Baggage Collection

 Slides and notes for my talk at UAL's Creative Computing Institute.

 To get started, fork and download this repo, then run:

 ```bash
 npm install && npm run dev -- --open
 ```

 This should start a dev server and open the slides in your browser.

 >NOTE: These slides were designed to be shared from my screen over a video call, so I haven't spent any time getting them to work on smaller screens. Sorry :)

 >NOTE 2: This project was made with `svelte@next` while it was in pre-release, so there are potentially some bugs (no breaking ones that i've seen so far, though you migth get a few warnings in the console).
